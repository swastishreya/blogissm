**Title:** Leveraging Video AI to Revolutionize Diagnostic Training in Dental Education 

**Description:** While AI has significantly advanced the medical domain, its application in dental education remains underexplored. Existing computer vision techniques, such as image and video segmentation and generation, offer promising avenues but require adaptation to meet the unique needs of dental diagnostics, such as caries detection and synthetic teeth generation. Our research seeks to address this gap by developing human-centered AI approaches tailored for real-world deployment. By focusing on aligning AI capabilities with practical clinical applications, we aim to enhance the diagnostic training experience for dental students, ultimately improving outcomes in dental education and patient care. 

**Research Plan:** 

1. Conduct an extensive literature review on existing AI methodologies for assistive dental diagnostic training.
2. Identify and analyze the limitations within current clinical settings, focusing on areas where AI can add value without causing disruption.
3. Develop innovative models and pipelines optimized for clinical environments, supporting dental students in their diagnostic training with enhanced precision and usability. 

This structured approach will ensure that our solutions address practical challenges, driving meaningful advancements in dental education through AI.
