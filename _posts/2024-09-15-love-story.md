If you’re reading this, you’re probably a Swiftie. High-five, you belong with me!\
My biggest flex is that I share my birthday with this legend named Taylor Swift. So, I’ve always wanted to attend one of her tours. When I was young, it was too much to ask of my parents. If you’re from a brown household, you probably understand. I wish I could fly-y, I’d pick myself up and go back in time.\
Naturally, by the time I ended up working out the logistics of making my dream come true, she was doing her Eras Tour. I either had too much work or thought I didn’t deserve to spend my time and money on the tickets. But, there’s nothing I hate more than what I can’t have.\
I even let go of the opportunity to attend the screening of the Eras Tour in Bangalore, was too depressed to go to one. It’s me hi, I’m the problem it’s me.\
I thought my once-in-a-lifetime chance to experience anything close to Taylor's concert was missed. A few months flew by and I found out I was headed to Amsterdam for my PhD. And guess what, she was supposed to perform in Amsterdam after a month I arrived. Taylor, can I go, where you go?\
But the legend Taylor Swift is, all the tickets were sold out a year earlier. Gathering my tears, I messaged a fellow Swiftie living in Amsterdam asking him whether he had any extra tickets. He himself didn’t have any! But this is the very first page, not where the storyline ends.\
I arrive in Amsterdam and I’m biking with this fellow Swiftie (also my only friend then) in Amsterdam. We bike around, get hot pot for dinner and I insist on staying with him until 12 am as it was his birthday the next day, said it was a small birthday present from my end. It's nice to have a friend!\
Next day he sends me 2 tickets to Eras Tour saying it was a return gift. (Aaaarrrrgggghhhhhhh!!!!!! RETURN GIFT!? BEST GIFT EVER!!) I may or may not have cried a bit both looking at the messages and when Taylor entered the stage. All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you, Taylor. The night was sparkling!\
You walked out of the stage with Travis Kelce right in front of me and I cheered you on. You were so gorgeous, it made me so mad!\
Miracles do happen. And I promise, I’ll remember it, all too well ❤️

**Easter eggs:** Of course I am sneaky like MOTHERRR. I planted her lyrics exerpts in this blog. You'll able to spot them all if you're a Swiftie and/or good at pattern recognition (sorry, couldn't leave that out, a lil' bit of me in everything I do!) And if you do end up finding all of them, let me take you out for a coffee  ☺️
